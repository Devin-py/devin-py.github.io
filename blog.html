      <h2>How to Get Started with React</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Published on January 1, 2025</p>
      <p>
        React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we’ll explore the basics
        of creating your first React application, including component structure, state management, and best practices.
        Whether you're coming from a different front-end framework or completely new to modern JavaScript development,
        React provides a straightforward approach to building scalable web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key features of React is its virtual DOM, which optimizes rendering performance by selectively updating
        only the parts of the UI that change. We’ll walk through a simple “Hello World” app, discuss JSX syntax, and then
        gradually introduce props and state. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a clear idea of how to structure your
        React components and how to handle data flow within your app.

      <h2>5 Tips to Improve Your CSS Skills</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Published on February 15, 2025</p>
      <p>
        CSS can be tricky, especially when dealing with responsive layouts and browser inconsistencies. Here are five
        practical tips you can use to enhance your CSS workflow. First, embrace modern layout modules like Flexbox and Grid:
        they simplify the process of building complex, responsive designs without relying on floats or hacks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, consider using a pre-processor like SASS or LESS to keep your styles organized and modular. Third, make use
        of browser DevTools to debug layout issues quickly. Fourth, regularly refactor your CSS to remove duplicates and
        ensure maintainability. Finally, keep an eye on performance: large CSS files can slow down page rendering.
